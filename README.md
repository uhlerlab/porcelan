# Repository overview

* `data` contains jupyter notebooks for downloading, simulating, and pre-processing the datasets used in the paper's results. For convenience, we also provide pre-processed data files in `data/preprocessed`. See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for further details.
* `figure_notebooks` contains jupyter notebooks to reproduce the paper's main and supplemental figures. Most results can be reproduced in a few seconds or minutes but we also provide the data files for the results displayed in the figures in `results` for convenience. See [`figure_notebooks/README.md`](figure_notebooks/README.md) for further details.
