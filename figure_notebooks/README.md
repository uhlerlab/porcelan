# Figure notebooks

The figure notebooks contain all code to reproduce the data files and plots
in the figures that were produced computationally. The data displayed in the 
figures is also provided in the `results` directory for any figures that take 
more than a few seconds to produce.

The figure notebooks are large due to interactive plots and may not be viewable
on GitHub. If you want to view them without downloading, you can check out these
copies on Colab:
