The figure notebooks contain all code to reproduce the data files and plots
in the figures that were produced computationally. The data files for the 
figures are also provided in the `results` directory for convenience.

The figure notebooks are large due to interactive plots and may not be viewable
on GitHub. If you want to view them without downloading, you can check out these
copies on Colab:
