# Tutorial

The tutorial works best on a machine with GPU capabilities and has not been tested on a CPU-only machine. 

**To run the tutorial using a local Jupyter notebook server:**

1.   Clone the [PORCELAN GitHub repo](https://github.com/uhlerlab/).
2.   Create a Python 3.8 virtual environment and install the required packages.
3.   Start a jupyter notebook server within in the main `porcelan` directory.
4.   Open this notebook on your jupyter notebook server. Alternatively you can connect a Google Colab 
     notebook to your local jupyter notebook server as described 
     [here](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html).
